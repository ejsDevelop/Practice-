        <p>Last night Julie and I went to putt and chip at Forest Park G.C.  This was the first time I have been able to do either b/c of my back for nearly a decade.  This was Julie's first experience putting on a <strong>real </strong>green and first time chipping, ever</p>

        <p>Plan on watching some of the Memorial today.  What a treat it is to listen to Jack (Nicklaus) for an extended period of time on the broadcast.</p>

        <p>Julie and I went to Forest Park G.C. tonight. We started off by putting.  Without me mentioning it to Julie, she did her prayer routine to groove her putting stroke.  After that, I helped her with her alignment, just by showing her where she was aimning.  She immediatedly took to it.  I wish I had her natural abilitly for alignment with her whole body.  The improvement on her chipping was incredible!  In total she has not hit a bucket yet and tonight she was doing well.  I can't wait to go with her again.  She is a fun, good and beaugtiful student!</p>

        <p>This is a shout out to all those wondering what I meant by praying and Julie with her putting routine.  Get into your natural putting stance without a club, and letting your arms hang down, put them togehter like you are prayin and rock your shoulders back and forth.  Feel like you have a triange and that you are rocking it with your shoulders.</p>
        <p>I am feeling a strong sense that I need to start this blog from the beginning with golf instruction for all of us to remember the basics.</p>

        <p>Julie and I went to Forest Park tonight to work on putting and chipping.  She made quite a bit of improvement on both.  I am super, uber, proud of her!.</p>
